ðŸ“¦ **ds** is a tiny command-line utility to help you save disk space by deep-stashing files and folders.
Use it to move items to an external location while keeping a local `.ds` file as a placeholder. Later, use the same command to restore them with ease. Handles wildcards, directories, and metadata cleanup.

âœ… Now with improved permission error handling â€” clear messages when access is denied to either the source or the stash directory.

Commands:
  â€¢ `ds --init` â†’ Set your deepstash folder
  â€¢ `ds <file or folder>` â†’ Deepstash item
  â€¢ `ds <file>.ds` â†’ Restore stashed item
